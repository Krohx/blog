<p>How I migrated the locked default channel on Slack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> is a communication platform built for teams. While it is free by default, there are features reserved for paid users. However, the free version already comes with a ton of cool features, and is highly usable as is, especially for teams that are relatively small. My team has stuck with this unpaid version of the application for a few months.</p>
<p>Recently, we decided to have our clients join our Slack team, with some envisaged benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It would ease the process of keeping the client up-to-date on project progress</li>
<li>It would bring our clients to our preferred communication platform, bringing them all in one place</li>
<li>We could leverage some of the many tools available for use with Slack to improve our communication with clients. It's worth noting that Slack is very API friendly.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
In doing this, we were presented with a small challenge. All of our previous conversations which had mostly being in the public, general channel, <strong><em>#general</em></strong>, were now open to our newly signed-on client. Some of these conversations obviously included stuff we would rather be more privy about. This meant I had to quickly find a way to <em>migrate</em> -- I chose not to <em>delete</em> -- the messages in the hope that he had not scrolled back through the channel's message log.</p>
<p>This would have been easier if Slack allowed certain modifications to the default channel named <em>#general</em><sup><strong>[1]</strong></sup>. For instance, Slack prevents the deletion of this channel. On top of that, Slack puts some restrictions on private channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can't be <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/213185307-Deleting-a-channel">deleted, but can be <em>archived</em></a>.</li>
<li>They can't be changed to <em>public</em> channels even though the reverse is possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
These limitations notwithstanding, the following explains my approach to tackling the problem.</p>
<p>First I used Slack's <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201658943-Exporting-your-team-s-Slack-history">export</a> feature to backup all of our conversations, including channel information. A caveat here is, <em>Slack does not include private channels' data with exported data by default</em><sup><strong>[2]</strong></sup>, but thankfully, we hadn't any private rooms at the time.</p>
<p>Now, Slack exports team data in JSON format, making it very easy to work with. Having downloaded the exported data, I started looking through it for parts that I could tweak.</p>
<p>There were some top-level (<strong>root folder</strong>) files which included meta-data about users, teams and channels. Then there were also folders for each channel, in which, conversation logs were kept, grouped by days.</p>
<p>Next, I edited the <code>channels.json</code> file in the top-level directory, and changed the name of the channel <em>#general</em>, which contained the messages, to some new name. Then I went and renamed the folder named <code>general</code>, to this new name.</p>
<p>With these changes in place, I compressed the modified files alongside the unmodified ones into a <em>zip</em> archive; the original Slack-exported data had come in a zip file as well. Slack allows you to <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201748703-Importing-message-history">import</a> this zip file into your Slack team, which was what I did next.</p>
<p>During the import, Slack automatically tried to match detected channels (from the import) with existing ones, after-which I was presented with a page that displayed the mapping suggestions. I simply set it not to map but create new channels instead.</p>
<p>Upon successful completion of the imports, I went on to delete all the messages in the existing <em>#general</em> channel. Those messages were now the contents of a newly minted channel, created using the new name I previously gave to it.</p>
<p>With all these in place, I did two more things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I edited and marked the new channel as <em>private</em>, and</li>
<li>I welcomed our new client to our Slack space <strong>;) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
